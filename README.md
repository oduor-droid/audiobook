a simple python program which takes in a user request to convert a pdf file into an audio stream.
The  libraries I have used here to complete the program are:
    pyttsx3
    PyPDF2

To use pyttsx3 python library, on debian based systems, install the following using terminal:

        pip3 install pyttsx3
        sudo apt install espeak or use sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
